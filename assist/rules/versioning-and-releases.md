# Versioning And Releases

## Version Policy

1. Package versions must stay in numeric semantic version form `1.0.<reference>` such as `1.0.172`.
2. Git tags must use the `v-` prefix such as `v-1.0.172`.
3. Changelog entry labels must use the human-readable form `v 1.0.172`.
4. The repository uses lockstep versioning across the root package and every implemented workspace package.

## Reference Policy

1. Every meaningful batch uses a reference number such as `#10`.
2. When execution tracking is active, the batch reference in `TASK.md` must match the current batch reference in `PLANNING.md`.
3. Installed app version `1.0.<reference>` must be derived directly from the same batch reference number.
4. Changelog entries must use the same reference number in the form `### [v 1.0.10] YYYY-MM-DD - Title`.
5. Commit subjects must start with the same reference number.

## Changelog Policy

1. `CHANGELOG.md` must contain a `Version State` block.
2. `Version State` must record the current numeric package version and current `v-` release tag.
3. `Version State` must document the versioned changelog label format.
4. The changelog must contain a matching version section such as `## v-1.0.172`.
5. New entries belong under the active version section until the next version bump is approved.

## Release Operation Policy

1. Version updates may be synchronized through `npm run version:sync` or the git helper before commit.
2. Version, changelog, and tag naming must stay aligned in the same batch.
3. Release tags must be created with the `v-` prefix.
4. Clean validation should exist before tagging a release.

## Build Output Policy

1. Standalone app builds belong under `build/app/<app>/<target>`.
2. Plugin or module builds belong under `build/module/<module>/<target>`.
3. Local tooling should respect the shared root build layout instead of scattering build outputs across app-local folders.
